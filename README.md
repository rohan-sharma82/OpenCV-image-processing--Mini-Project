## ðŸ“¸ **Basic Image Processing with OpenCV**

This repository contains a simple Python script that demonstrates fundamental image processing

techniques using OpenCV and NumPy.

### ðŸ”§ Features Implemented
- **Image Reading:** Load and display images from your local directory.
- **Grayscale Conversion:** Transform images from color (BGR) to black & white.
- **Image Resizing:** Shrink images to half their original resolution.
- **Image Flipping:** Flip images vertically (you can experiment with horizontal and both-axis flips too).
- **Image Cropping:** Extract specific sections of the image using array slicing.
- **Shape & Dimension Display:** Print the dimensions of each processed image to the console.
